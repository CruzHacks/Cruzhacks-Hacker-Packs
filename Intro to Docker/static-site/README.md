# Docker Static Site

This is a fork of the [Docker Static Site example][1] for MLH Localhost Intro
to Docker workshops.

## Running the Example

To run this example, you need to build the Docker Image first. To do so, run
the following command:

```
$ docker build -t docker-static-site .
```

After you've built the image, you can run it as follows:

```
$ docker run -d -p 8888:80 docker-static-site
```

The website should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8888/][2].
